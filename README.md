## Sumary

- [Requirements](https://github.com/brnfra/dotfiles#requirements)
- [Install](https://github.com/brnfra/dotfiles#how-to-install)
- [Pull state from remote after installation](https://github.com/brnfra/dotfiles#pull-state-from-remote-to-local-config)

- [Dependencies(check your pkgs)](https://github.com/brnfra/dotfiles#dependencies)

## My config files to automate computer changing configuration.

### Desktop config(The main branch. Two monitors, monitor2 is left rotated, one in vertical)

1. Config files for Gnu/Linux based distro systems(Made on **Debian based**, pls check first).
2. The config files expect *two monitors* in main branch, maybe you have to change some things in *wallpaper* and *resolution* script in ```~/.config/i3/autostart```.
    - The **$HOME/.config/i3/autostart/wallpaper.sh** will change **different wallpaper** for
 each monitor, if you don't want this, change it. Put the images files in ```~/.wallpapers```
3. The i3config script _rotate the 2nd monitor to right and move it to right of the first_ in desktop config.
4. The keyboard layout is **US-INT**.

### Notebook config(notebook-cfg branch)

1. Config files for Gnu/Linux based distro systems.(Made on **Debian based**, pls check first)
2. I3blocks include charge icon, and wifi signal scripts.
3. Wallpapers autochange(must have included in folder ~/.wallpapers
4. The keyboard layout is **PT-BR,ABNT**.

### Mingw32(git-for-windows) config(mingw32-w8 branch)

1. Config files for Gnu/Linux based distro systems(git-bash.exe).
2. Remove scripts for programs for linux systems.
3. Remove .config/ folder and some configurations.
4. The keyboard layout is **PT-BR,ABNT**.

**ATTENTION**: Please, DO NOT copy/run any file here in your system **if you do not fully understand what it does**. Seriously, **DON'T do it!**)**

## TODO

- [x] Auto update script from repository
- [x] Branches for each computers
- [x] Remove unecessary scripts for mingw32
- [x] Fix audio/mic control for notebook-cfg in i3block config
- [ ] Tested and refactoring

<br>

## Requirements

- Git
- Ssh 
- Curl

## How to install
 
This method consist to use git to track your config files. **You don't have to install extra tool**, only need git, ssh(coreutils) and curl.
Install config tracking in your **$HOME** following the comand;

1. Fork this repository.

2. Edit file  /[YOUR_USER_NAME]/dotfiles/bin/install_enviroment to put your username and email.

3. Execute script bellow ( **change username** ).

>If Desktop/Virtual Machine, copy/paste in terminal;
```bash
curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[YOUR_USER_NAME]/dotfiles/main/bin/install | /bin/bash
```
>If Mingw for Windows, copy/paste in terminal;
```bash
curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[YOUR_USER_NAME]/dotfiles/main/bin/install-mingw-cfg | /bin/bash
```
>If Notebook(batery and temp indicator, wifi graduated signa), copy/paste in terminal;
```bash
curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[YOUR_USER_NAME]/dotfiles/main/bin/install-note-cfg | /bin/bash
```

<br>

The script ```~/bin/install_enviroment``` has my username and email. Configure your locals definitions. Type and go. 
*Read and edit it first for your purpose*, it will create some folders and copy config files, you can fork this repo and coment that line.
Attention on ssh-key problems, just in case, you find help [here](https://docs.github.com/pt/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
<br>

- [**Optional**] If you'll create enviroment to Java, Spring and React the script ___java_spring_react.sh___ gonna install *Heroku CLI*, *Postman*, *VSCode* and *Spring Tool Suite* in folder ```~/.local/opt/``` and add the **PATH** to **.bash_exports**.
In the ``` ~/bin```  folder there are scripts for each case.

## Pull state from remote to local config

After install, if remote has changed configuration and you want pull it, *How can I update local for this change?*
- You can pull to your local repository run the script below. 

In the folder ```~/bin``` there is a script named ```pull-config``` such make a "**pull request**" like a normal git repo. Just run;
```
$ bash ~/bin/pull-config
```
Now, Git gonna **update snapshot** from remote repo to your $HOME folder.

## Update remote state from local to remote 

If I change configuration and like it, *How can I update for this change?*
- You can update your remote repository and, after tests, run the script below. 

1. Clone this repo in another local.(here the default is ``` ~/documents/projects/git/ ``` )
2. Change to the correspondent branch by ```git switch [main/mingw32-w8/notebook-cfg]``` 
3. Make the changes and push to remote repo in correspondent branch. 
4. In the computers run pull script and receive the updates.(wait a minute in the same computer to update HEAD)

In the folder ```~/bin``` there is a script named ```stage-local-config``` gonna make copy my edited config files to
**dotfiles** folder. Now check the status and if it's fine proceed to push changes, just run;
```
$ git push origin [main/mingw32-w8/notebook-cfg]
```
Now, Git gonna **update snapshot** from local to remote.

## Dependencies

Some pkgs here are installed in my computer, after fork, **make changes to yours needs**.

- nm-applet(tool to show network icon)
- diodon(tool to show transfer area icon)
- gnome-screenshot(printscreen)
- compton(composer)
- nitrogen(wallpaper)
- fzf
- fdfind
- exa

Some functions require some aplications and packages like xorg,fzf,fdfind for example.
If you want full functions here will required, for some functions, the previous installation of some packages like;


- I3wm configs
- I3blocks and I3status configs
- Compton
- Vim
- NeoVim
- Vifm
- Rofi
- Xfce4-terminal
- fzf
- tmux 

## Problems

If you get the message after or try update your local configs, try this

1. Delete, in your home folder, ```  ~/.dotfiles/``` .

2. Re-run the command curl for install again.

For other problems, again, check your name and email in install_enviroment or comment.
