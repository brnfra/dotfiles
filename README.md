1. Config files for Gnu/Linux based distro systems.
2. The config files expect *two monitors*, maybe you have to change some things.
3. The **~/.config/i3/autostart/wallpaper.sh** will change **different wallpaper** for
   each monitor, if you don't want this change it.
4. The i3config script _rotate the 2nd monitor to right and move to right of the
   first_.
5. The keyboard layout is **US-INT**.

**ATTENTION**: Please, DO NOT copy/run any file here in your system **if you do not fully understand what it does**. Seriously, **DON'T do it!**)
